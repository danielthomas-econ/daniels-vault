The conditional probability density function of $Y$ given $X=x$ is $$f_{{Y|X}}(y|x)=\dfrac{{f(x,y)}}{f_{X}(x)}$$
This works as $f(x,y)$ tells us when we have specific values of $X=x$ and $Y=y$, and dividing by $f_{X}(x)$ gives us the probability for a specific value of $X$, instead of all $X$ (which is the issue with $f(x,y)$).
