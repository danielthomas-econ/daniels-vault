## The classical theory of interest rate
In the classical model, *the components of AD explicitly determine the interest rate.* In fact, it is the interest rate that ensures that exogenous changes in the components of AD do not change the AD.

For simplicity, we assume *borrowing consists of selling a standard bond* and lending is buying a bond. This makes sense because if you are selling a bond, you are getting current consumption at the expense of future consumption, just like borrowing. The suppliers of bonds are firms and governments, while households demand bonds. **The borrowers supplied bonds and hence demand loanable funds, while lenders demanded bonds and hence supplied loanable funds.** 

Classical economists believed that investment and interest have a negative relation, while savings and interest have a positive one. Therefore, in the market for loanable funds, the demand curve is downward sloping and the supply curve is upward sloping.

### Stabilizing role of interest rates
Let us look at how interest rates play a stabilizing role by considering a fall in expected profitability of an investment. **This is an exogenous decrease in investment, and it also shifts the demand curve for loanable funds to the left.** Assuming there is no government deficit, we get the following graph:

At the initial rate $r_{0}$, once investment falls to $I_{1}$, we have excess supply of loanable funds. This puts a downward pressure on interest rates to fall to the new equilibrium rate $r_{1}$. **Two adjustments occur here.** Firstly, savings fall so consumption rises. This is shown by the distance $A$. Secondly, a fall in interest rate induces greater investment, shown by $B$.

At the new equilibrium, the increase in consumption (fall in savings) and increase in induced investment is equal to the fall in autonomous investment. Therefore,
$$\Delta (A+B)=\Delta I$$
*Therefore, any exogenous decrease in $I$ is balanced out by an increase in $C$ and $I$ due to the interest rates. This leaves $AD$ unchanged, which is the stabilizing role of interest rates.*

## Fiscal policy
Under fiscal policy, we look at the effects of increasing government spending. However, we must first look at how this increased government spending is financed. The government has three sources of funds: taxes, selling bonds (borrowing) or printing money. For now, we'll assume money supply and tax collections are fixed. **Therefore, increased government spending is funded by increased borrowing (selling bonds).**

We can immediately state that *bond financing has no impact on output or price level since neither the AD nor the AS curve refer to the level of government spending.* Since output is unaffected, so is employment.

We assume that before the increase in government spending, the budget was balanced ($G=T$). Therefore, investment $I$ is the only source of demand for loanable funds. *When the government uses bond financing, demand for loanable funds becomes $I+(G-T)$*. This shifts the demand curve rightward by $(G-T)$. This results in a new loan market equilibrium with a higher interest rate.

There are *two effects* of the increased interest rate:
i) **Savings increase** from $S_{0}$ to $S_{1}$. This increase in savings is mirrored by an equal **decline in consumption.** Households prefer future consumption as the rate of interest is higher, so they spend less in the current period. This is *denoted by A.*
ii) **Investment falls** from $I_{0}$ to $I_{1}$. As interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing increases, making less investments profitable. This is *denoted by B.*

We can observe that **the increased government spending is entirely offset by the fall in consumption and investment. Therefore, there is no change in AD.** Since AD does not change, there is **no change in price level** either. The increased government spending increased the interest rate enough to reduce an equivalent amount of private expenditure. This is called *the crowding out effect.* 

Instead of using bonds, the government could also just print the money. **Since there is an increase in the quantity of money, price level rises proportionately.** In the classical model, all increases in money supply are treated the same, regardless of its source. Therefore, the government printing money just shifts the AD curve to the right while the AS curve is fixed, thereby increasing prices.

## Tax policy
Before we discuss changes in tax policy, we need to understand the difference between a lump sum tax change and a change in the marginal tax rate.

**Lump sum tax reductions affect the demand side** of the economy. They do not change any incentives for the individual, they just leave the individual with more disposable income at the end. Therefore, their consumption increases and AD shifts rightward. *However, the government might choose to sell bonds to replace revenue lost by the tax cut.* In this case, the same crowding out process as before takes place. Interest rate will rise, investment will fall, and the interest rate induced fall in consumption will bring back consumption to pre-tax levels. Therefore, *in this case, AD is not affected.* If the government prints money to replace lost revenues, then AD will rise and price levels also increase. Still, **a lump sum tax change has no independent effect on AD.** 

**Marginal tax rate reductions affect the supply side** of the economy. Since they increase after tax wages, *they fundamentally alter the incentives to work, shifting the labor supply curve to the right.* This makes sense because **workers actually care about after tax real wages,** which is $\dfrac{(1-t^y)W}{P}$, where $t^y$ is the marginal tax rate. We now operate with the labor supply function $N^s=g\left[ \dfrac{(1-t^y)W}{P} \right]$. The rightward shift in $N^s$ increases output and shifts the AS curve to the right while the AD curve is unchanged. **Therefore, output increases and price levels fall** with a fall in marginal tax rate.

### Final takeaways of fiscal and tax policy
Changes in government spending and tax have **no effect on AD** due to the stabilizing role of interest and the crowding-out effect. However, a change in marginal tax rate **affects the AS curve** and changes the output, employment and price levels in the economy.

## Monetary policy
Remember that classical economists believed that money only determined nominal variables (price level, nominal income) and had *no impact on real variables* (output, employment, interest). Therefore, the quantity of money had no impact on the equilibrium values of real variables. 

However, since money supply determined the price level and nominal income, *classicals still believed there was a need to keep the money supply stable to keep prices stable.* Therefore, monetary policy was important, but only to ensure price stability and not to adjust real variables in the economy.
