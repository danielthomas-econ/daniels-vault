## Bond pricing and interest rates
Suppose you have a bond that will pay you $\$A$ in a year (called a treasury bill or T-bill). Let's say the interest rate is $10\%$. Then, the bond price ($P$) you'd be willing to pay is $P(1.1)=A\implies P= \dfrac{A}{1.1}$. If the interest rate is $5\%$, then the price you'd pay is $P=\dfrac{A}{1.05}$. **Clearly, you will pay less if you will earn a higher price in the future. So there is an inverse relationship between bond pricing and interest rates.**

The general form of this relation is $P_{B}= \dfrac{A}{1+i}$. You can rearrange this to get $i = \dfrac{{A-P_{B}}}{{P_{B}}}$. *This essentially is the percentage increase in bond price from purchase price $P_{B}$ to par value $A$*. The increase in the value of the bond is the interest rate received.
