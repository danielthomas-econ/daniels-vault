## The money multiplier
We know $H=[c+\theta(1-c)]\$YL(i)$ and that $\$YL(i)$ gives us the total demand for money. If we want to find equilibrium where total demand = total supply, we can simply shift $[c+\theta(1-c)]$ to the other side to isolate total demand. Therefore, we get:
$$\dfrac{1}{[c+\theta(1-c)]}H=\$YL(i)$$
This tells us that *the total demand for money is equal to the demand for central bank money times some constant.* We know that for $c, \theta \in(0,1)$, $[c+\theta(1-c)]<1$. Therefore, its inverse is greater than 1. That is why it is called the money multiplier. Therefore, **the total supply of money is equal to the central bank money times the money multiplier.**

To calculate total money creation, we can take $\$100$ common. This leaves us with [[College work/Mathematical methods for Economics/Limits, Continuity and Series/Series#Infinite geometric series|the sum of an infinite geometric series.]] Finally, we get $100\times 10 = 1000$. *Note that this is the same as multiplying the central bank money by the money multiplier.*

This gives us another way to think about the money multiplier: **the increase in money supply as the result of successive rounds of bond purchases,** started by the central bank and continued by the banks.
