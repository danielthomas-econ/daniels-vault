## What is an IS curve?
The IS (investment-savings) curve shows the combinations of interest rates and level of output such that planned spending equals income. In simpler terms, it *shows all the points at which the goods market is in equilibrium.*

To derive this curve, we start by adding an extra layer of complexity to our old model. Previously, we assumed investment to be some autonomous $\bar{I}$. *Now, investment depends on the interest rate.* We'll find an investment function and then sub it into the aggregate demand formula.

## Investment function
It is pretty obvious that **interest and investment have an inverse relation.** When interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing goes up. This makes fewer investment projects profitable due to the rising cost, so firms will undertake less investments. Putting this in an equation gives us:
$$\begin{align}
I=\bar{I} - bi, &  & b>0
\end{align}$$
**The coefficient $b$ measures the responsiveness of investment to interest rates.** It must be positive so that the inverse relation still holds. Plotting the investment function gives us a linear downward sloping line. 

### Slope of the investment function
Since $I=\bar{I}-bi$, finding the slope $\dfrac{dy}{dx}=\dfrac{di}{dI}=\dfrac{{-1}}{b}$. Therefore,
$$\text{Slope of the investment function }= \dfrac{{-1}}{b}$$
This tells us that a larger $b$ gives us a flatter curve and vice versa. Let us represent this diagrammatically.

We can see that $\Delta I$ is a lot larger with a flatter curve. Since a larger $\Delta I$ indicates a larger responsiveness of investment to interest rates, **flatter investment curves with larger $\Delta I$ must have a larger $b$**.
