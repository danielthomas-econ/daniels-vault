## Fundamental identity of national income accounting
$\text{Total production = Total income = Total expenditure}$

## Measuring GDP
### Expenditure approach
$Y=C+I+G+NX$, where:
$C=\text{consumption}$
$I=\text{investment}$
$G=\text{government purchases of goods and services}$
$NX=\text{net exports of goods and services}$

This formula is also called the *income-expenditure identity* since it states that income $Y$, is equal to the total expenditure in the economy.

### Income approach
$NDP=\text{Compensation of employees + Operating Surplus + Income of self employed}$
This formula gives us **national income.** Adding statistical discrepancy to that gives us **NNP, not GDP.** We need to add depreciation and subtract NFIA to get GDP.

We can further break down operating surplus into:
$OS = \text{Rent + Royalties + Interest + Profits}$
Profits can also be broken down into:
$\text{Profits = Corporate income tax + Dividends paid + Retained earnings}$

### Statistical discrepancy
$\text{Statistical discrepancy = Production measure - Income measure}$

### Private disposable income
$\text{Private disposable income = }Y+NFP+TR+INT-T$, where:
$Y=\text{GDP}$
$NFP=\text{Net factor payments from abroad (NFIA)}$
$TR=\text{Transfers received from the government}$
$INT=\text{Interest payments on government debt}$
$T=\text{Taxes}$

### Net government income
$\text{Net govt. income = }T-TR-INT$

## Savings and wealth
$S=Y-C$, or $\text{Savings = Income - Consumption}$

$\text{Wealth = Assets - Liabilities}$ (like capital in accounts)

### Savings rate
$\text{Savings rate = } \dfrac{{Savings}}{Income}$

### Private savings
$S_{pvt}=\text{Private disposable income} - \text{Consumption}$
$S_{pvt}=(Y+NFP+TR+INT-T)-C$

Note that **investment is not subtracted from private disposable income.** This is because capital goods are purchased to *enhance future productive capacity,* not to satisfy current needs.

### Government savings (Budget surplus)
$S_{govt}=\text{Net govt. income}- \text{government purchases}$
$S_{govt}=(T-TR-INT)-G$

Technically, we shouldn't be subtracting government investment (included in $G$) for the same reason given above. But for the questions in the book, separating government consumption and investment is an unnecessary complication and we don't need to do that.

### National savings
$$\begin{align}
S&=S_{pvt}+S_{govt} \\
&=(Y+NFP+TR+INT-T-C)+(T-TR-INT-G) \\
&=Y+NFP-C-G \\
&=\text{Total income}-\text{Total consumption}
\end{align}$$

### Savings in terms of current account
Sub $Y=C+I+G+NX$ in the equation above. We get:
$S=(C+I+G+NX)+NFP-C-G$
$S=I+NX+NFP$
$S=I+CA$
$\text{National savings = Investment + Current account balance}$

### Current account balance
$CA=NX+NFP$

### Uses of savings identity
We know $S=I+CA$. Sub $S=S_{pvt}+S_{govt}$. We get:
$S_{pvt}=I+(-S_{govt})+CA$

This tells us that private savings are used in three ways:
i) *Investment:* Firms borrow from private savers to purchase new capital

ii) *Government budget deficit:* When the government runs a budget deficit, then $-S_{govt}$ becomes positive. The identity shows us that governments must borrow from private savers to cover the deficit.

iii) *Current account balance:* Private savings are used to cover current account deficits. They also balance out surpluses as private savings can be used to invest abroad and balance the CA.
