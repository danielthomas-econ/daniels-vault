## Social vs private benefits and costs
We need to make an important distinction between how society interprets benefits and costs vs how private players interpret these factors. *The demand curve only reflects the private benefits to individual market players.* The level of a certain commodity demanded by a consumer is determined by his preferences and willingness to pay, not by the benefits his consumption gives to society.

This gives rise to two separate demand curves: One that shows private demand and one that shows social demand. Although we cannot get an exact value of social benefits, we can estimate it relative to the private benefit. **If a good creates a positive externality, it has greater social benefit. Therefore, the social demand curve will be to the right of the private demand curve and vice versa.** ^85cbc9

## Market inefficiencies caused by externalities
Whenever we deal with an externality, we move away from perfect competition, and hence we move away from the most optimal output. Let us consider the case of a positive externality. Since the social demand curve is to the right of the private demand curve, *the society demands a higher equilibrium quantity than private individuals do. However, the market only produces at the level that the private market deems necessary.*

We get the following diagram:

We notice that the market produces $M$ units, even though the total benefit to society is maximized at $S$ units of output. This gives us a **very important result: markets do not take social benefits into account,** and therefore underestimate the total benefit of producing additional units of a commodity. **This means markets will always underproduce goods with a positive externality.** 

In this case, we know $S$ units provides the greatest benefit to society. However, the markets underproduce and will only give us $M$ units of the commodity. The $\triangle STM$ represents *all the units for which social benefits > social costs, but they aren't being produced.* This would be surplus is lost as the market doesn't account for social benefits, meaning it falsely believes $M$ is the optimal level of output. *Since these goods that increase surplus aren't being produced, the deadweight loss is* $\triangle STM$.
