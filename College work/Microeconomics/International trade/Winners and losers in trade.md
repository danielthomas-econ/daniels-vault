## Gains and losses of an exporting country
A country exports if the world price is greater than the domestic price. When this happens, *no seller would accept anything less than the world price, and no buyer would pay more than the world price.* 

Even though the price isn't at the equilibrium price $P_{d}$, the market is at equilibrium as there is a new player in the market: the rest of the world. **The demand curve is perfectly elastic at the world price, since the rest of the world is willing to buy whatever quantity at that price.** The rest of the world won't pay anything above $P_{w}$ because then they could simply buy from another country at $P_{w}$. *Therefore, the demand curve facing domestic sellers is perfectly elastic.*

Despite having nearly infinite demand, the sellers will only sell until $Q'$ quantity, as after that point, their reservation price becomes greater than the world price. **It is important to note that sellers don't sell their entire quantity to the rest of the world.** As seen in the graph, the domestic demand curve intersects the world price at the quantity $\hat{Q}$. *Since the sellers will only sell at world price, they only sell this quantity to the domestic buyers.* Therefore, domestic sellers sell $Q'$ quantity in total, and $\hat{Q}$ out of that goes to domestic buyers. This means $\text{Total exports} = Q'-\hat{Q}$.
