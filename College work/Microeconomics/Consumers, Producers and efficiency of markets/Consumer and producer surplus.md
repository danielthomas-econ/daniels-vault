The point of consumer and producer surplus is to examine the benefit received by these parties for engaging in the market. We'll start off by looking at it from the buyer's point of view.

## Consumer surplus
The consumer surplus is the *amount a buyer was willing to pay minus the amount they actually pay.* The maximum amount a buyer is willing to pay is also called their *'reservation price'.* For example, if I valued a pair of sneakers at 150 dirhams but the shop sold it to me for 100, then my consumer surplus would be 50 dirhams. In this sense, consumer surplus **measures the benefit received by the buyers for participating in the market.**

Since the demand curve represents the consumer's willingness to pay, we can use it to measure the consumer surplus. For all demand curves, **the area above the price line and below the demand curve is the total consumer surplus.** In the below diagram, consumers 1-6 are gaining some amount since the price 20 is lower than their reservation price. However, consumers 7 and 8 get no consumer surplus since they did not purchase any commodity.

> In this case, the consumers are willing to pay exactly one price, which is their reservation price (max price they will pay). If the price goes above this, they'll buy nothing, and they'll buy an infinite quantity if the price goes below this.<br><br>Therefore, we can see that the max willingness to pay is the same as the market price here. This means that consumer surplus = willingness to pay - market price = 0.

### Markets vs centrally planned economy
In a market, everyone has a choice to buy or not buy given the market price. Consumers will choose to buy a commodity if its price is lower than their reservation price. In other words, *consumers in a market only purchase a good if they get a positive consumer surplus from it.* Others can simply choose to not buy the commodity and get 0 consumer surplus.
 
In a centrally planned economy, **buyers have to buy a fixed quantity of goods at a certain price, regardless of their consumer surplus.** In the above graph, this means that consumers 7 and 8 would have to purchase the commodity even though that would result in negative consumer surplus. Therefore, there'll always be some consumers with negative surplus.

Therefore, we can say that *the consumer surplus in perfectly competitive markets are always greater than that of the consumer surplus in a centrally planned economy.*

### As a measure of welfare
Since this chapter is about welfare economics, we want to look at consumer surplus from a welfare standpoint. So should policymakers look at maximizing consumer surplus when designing new policies? 

We know that consumer surplus measures the benefit for the consumers. However, we have to note that **this benefit is as the buyers themselves perceive it.** It may not be an objective benefit for the buyer, but the buyer might consider it as a benefit from their POV. Therefore, *consumer surplus is a good indicator of welfare if a policymaker wants to satisfy the preferences of the buyers.*

However, there are cases when **policymakers disregard consumer surplus entirely when they do not respect the preferences that drive the buyer's behavior.** For example, lets consider drug addicts. Their consumer surplus will be maximized (from their POV) when the price of a drug is very low. However, *that is not in the interest of society.* In this instance, consumers surplus is not a good indicator since an addict isn't looking after their best interest.

*In general however, consumer surplus does a decent job at portraying economic welfare.* This is because most market participants are rational players, so they make the choices that maximize their own benefit (and when everyone does this, society's benefit is maximized). Economists also believe that consumer preferences should be respected. In this case, *consumers are the best judges of how much benefit they receive.*

## Producer surplus
A seller is willing to supply his goods or services if the price received is greater than the cost of production. In this case, his cost of production is his reservation price. **The cost here is opportunity cost, not just explicit cost.** A producer surplus is the amount a seller is paid minus the cost of production. It measures the benefits a seller receives for participating in market activities.

Since the height of the supply curve indicates the sellers cost, **we can calculate producer surplus as the area below the price and above the supply curve.**
