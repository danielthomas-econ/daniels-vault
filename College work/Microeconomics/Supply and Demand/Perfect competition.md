A market is a group of buyers and sellers of a particular good or service. Economists call a market 'competitive' when *there are so many buyers and sellers that each has a negligible impact on the market price.* A market is perfectly competitive if three main criteria are met:
- The infinitely large number of buyers and sellers **make decisions without strategizing.**
- Only one homogenous commodity is sold
- All market participants have perfect information.

> [!NOTE] The market participants are **price takers**
> Since the buyers and sellers in a perfectly competitive market *have to accept the price determined by the market,* they are called price takers. At this price, buyers buy all they want, and seller sell all they want. If a seller charges more, buyers will go elsewhere. At the same time, no single buyer can influence the price since they only purchase a small amount of the total goods sold.
