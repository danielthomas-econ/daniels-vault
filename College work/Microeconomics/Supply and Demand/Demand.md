## Basics of demand
Demand refers to a consumer's willingness and ability to pay for a certain good. The **quantity demanded** of any good refers to the amount of the good that buyers are willing and able to purchase. When all other things remain the same, *as the price of a good increases, its demand decreases.* This is called the *Law of Demand.* 

## Demand curve
The demand curve is a **graphical representation of the relation between price and quantity demanded.** It is VERY IMPORTANT to remember that it isn't the relation between price and demand, but price and *quantity demanded.* 

The demand curve is a downward sloping curve due to the law of demand. The downward slope represents the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded.

> [!tip] Demand curve is said to be a "planned curve"
> The demand curve is a planned curve *in response to the price in the market.* If the buyer sees $x$ price (an incentive), he will be willing to purchase $y$ quantity. This is the buyer's plan. Hence, demand curve is a planned curve.

### Shifts in the demand curve
Due to factors which will be discussed soon, demand of a commodity increases and decreases. In response to these changes, the demand curve shifts rightward and leftward respectively.

As we can see below, rightward shift $\implies$ increase in demand, and a leftward shift $\implies$ decrease in demand.

## Determinants of demand
Demand is a complex thing that is determined by a number of variables. These variables are usually represented as a *demand function* $D(P_x,P_r,Y,T,E)$. Let's go a little further in depth and explore each variable.

### 1. Price of the commodity
As the law of demand states, when all other things remain constant, if the price of a good increases, its demand decreases. Therefore, there is a clear **inverse relationship** between the price of a commodity and its quantity demanded.

### 2. Income of the consumer
The way in which income affects the demand of a commodity *depends on what type of good is in question.* We would logically assume that as our income increases, we can afford to buy more things, so our demand would increase as well. This is partly true. **A direct relation between income and demand is seen in normal goods.** These are regular goods which are desirable to us.

On the other hand, there are some goods which we may not want. For example, when my income increases, I will demand less Nokia brick phones and demand more Samsung phones. This **inverse relation is seen in inferior goods.** Inferior goods are those goods whose consumption we reduce as our income increases. In the above example, Nokia phone is my inferior good while the Samsung phone is my normal good.

> [!NOTE] Inferior vs normal good is subjective
> There is no hard and fast rule that $x$ commodity is normal while $y$ commodity is inferior. *This varies from person to person.* For a lower income consumer, he may see Nokia phones as a normal good. Similarly, a multi-billionaire may see a BMW as an inferior good since he prefers a Rolls Royce, while most of us would consider a BMW as a normal good. We can only differentiate between normal and inferior **based on the choice of a consumer.**

### 3. Price of related goods
The impact of the price of related goods on demand once again depends on what type of good is in question. There are two types here: **Substitutes and Complements.** 

Substitutes are *goods that are used in place of another,* like idli and dosa. **Substitutes have a direct relation between price and demand.** If the price of idlis increases, I will replace the consumption of idlis with the cheaper alternative, which is dosas. Therefore, an increase in the price of a good will increase the demand for its substitute.

Complements are *goods that are used together,* like petrol and cars. **Complements have an inverse relation between price and demand.** If the price of petrol shoots up, I'm less likely to buy a car now. Therefore, an increase in the price of a good will reduce the demand for its complementary good.
