There are some types of implications that modify the standard $p\to q$ implication in their own ways. The main ones are converse, inverse and contrapositive implications. 

We'll use the implication "If you live in Delhi, then you live in India" as an example to explain the different types. Here, "you live in Delhi" is $p$, and "you live in India" is $q$.

## Converse
The converse of a conditional statement is **simply its reverse.** The converse of $p\to q$ is $q\to p$. The converse of "if $p$, then $q$" is "if $q$, then $p$". If the implication and its converse are both true, the statement is said to be *biconditional.*

The converse of our example will be "If you live in India, you live in Delhi". Obviously, this is a false statement. Therefore, our original implication is not a biconditional one.

## Inverse
The inverse of a conditional statement is the **negation of the original statement.** We denote negation using either $\sim$ or $\neg$. Therefore, the inverse of $p\to q$ is $\sim p\to \sim q$, and "if $p$, then $q$" becomes "if $\sim p$, then $\sim q$".

This inverse of our example will be "If you don't live in Delhi, then you don't live in India". Once again, this is clearly a false statement. *If the converse is false, the inverse is necessarily false and vice versa* since both these types share the same truth value.

## Contrapositive
The contrapositive of a conditional statement is the **reverse negation of the conditional statement.** It is basically *the converse of the inverse.* The contrapositive of $p\to q$ is $\sim q \to \sim p$ and "if $p$, then $q$" becomes "if $\sim q$, then $\sim p$".

The contrapositive of our example is "If you don't live in India, you don't live in Delhi". This is true since if you don't live in India, you cannot live in a city in India. *If the original conditional statement is true, then the contrapositive is necessarily true and vice versa* since they share the same truth value. Since a contrapositive is a reverse negation, **it has the same effect of a double negative,** which we know takes us back to our original statement.
