### Domain
The domain is the set of **all possible inputs** for the function. It is typically considered to be the whole of the first set (set $A$). Example: For $f: R \to R$ defined by $f(x) = x^2$, there is *no restriction on possible inputs.* Therefore, the domain of this relation is $R$ (all real numbers).


### Codomain
The codomain is the set of **all theoretically possible outputs** of the function, regardless of whether those values are actually obtained or not. This is usually the whole of set $B$. Using the same relation as an example, the codomain will also be $R$ (represented by the second R). This is because *the function maps to all real numbers,* even if some numbers (like negative values) cannot be the output.


### Range
The range is the set of **all the values obtained when the function is applied** to elements of the domain. The range will *always be a subset of the codomain.* In our example, the range will be $[0,\infty)$, since any non-negative real number can be an output of the function $f(x) = x^2$. Our codomain was $R$, and we can see that our range is only a subset of R (only non-negative values of R).
