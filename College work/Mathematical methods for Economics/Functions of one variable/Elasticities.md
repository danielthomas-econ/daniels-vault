We know that the price elasticity of demand is the change in quantity demanded divided by the change in price. To make it relative to the price and quantity, we use the mathematical formula $E_{d}=\dfrac{p}{q}\times \dfrac{dq}{dp}$. If we have demand as a function of price, like $D(p)$, then elasticity is $\dfrac{p}{D(p)}\times \dfrac{dD(p)}{dp}$. In general, we can write it as $E_{d}=\dfrac{x}{f(x)}\times f'(x)$.



## Flashcards
Q1) If $D(p) = \dfrac{100}{p^{3/2}}$, prove that elasticity of demand is a constant.
?
Ans) $D'(p)= -\dfrac{150}{p^{5/2}}$
$E_{d}= \dfrac{dD(p)}{dp}\times \dfrac{p}{D(p)}$
$=-\dfrac{150} {p^{5/2}} \times p\cdot \dfrac{p^{3/2}}{100}$. *The $p$ terms cancel out,* leaving us with $E_{d}=-1.5$.
