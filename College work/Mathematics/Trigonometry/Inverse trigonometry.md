Inverse trigonometric functions are denoted by the prefix $arc$ or by a $^{-1}$ exponent. Eg: $arcsin\:\theta$ or $sin^{-1}\:\theta$. Inverse trig functions basically ask *for what angle will we get the value of the inverse trig argument.* It's much easier to understand with an example. $arcsin\:\dfrac{\sqrt2}{2}$ is asking us "For what value of $sin$ will we get $\dfrac{\sqrt2}{2}$?". It is the same as writing $sin\:?=\dfrac{\sqrt2}{2}$.
