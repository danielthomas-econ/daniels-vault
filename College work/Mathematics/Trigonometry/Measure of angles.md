There are two different ways by which we can measure an angle: degree measure and radian measure. 

## Degree measure
Under a degree system of measurement, *one full rotation of an angle is $360\degree$*. Therefore, $1\degree$ is $\frac{1}{360}th$ of a rotation. If the degree measure is positive, we move the angle counter-clockwise, but if the measure is negative, we move it clockwise. $1\degree$ can be broken down into $60^\prime$ (read minutes).

## Radian measure
Under the radian measure system, we **measure the angles in terms of arc length.** This is because the smaller the angle, the shorter the length of the arc formed and vice versa. We get the angle $\theta$ by using $\dfrac{arc\:length}{radius} (\frac{l}{r})$. *One full rotation covers $2\pi$ radians.* 

### Relationship between radians and degrees
We know that one full rotation is equal to $2\pi$ radians and $360\degree$. **This tells us that $\pi$ radians = $180\degree$**. We can convert degrees into radians using:$$Radian\:measure = \dfrac{\pi}{180}\times Degree\:measure $$
We will come across angles that are multiples of $30\degree$ often, so its best to memorize their radian conversion in a simple way. Since $30\degree = \dfrac{\pi}{6}$, *any multiple of $30\degree$ will be a multiple of $\dfrac{\pi}{6}$ too.*
Therefore, $150\degree$, which is $30\times 5$, will be $5\times \dfrac{\pi}{6}=\dfrac{5\pi}{6}$ radians.

 Similarly, we can say that since $45\degree = \dfrac{\pi}{4}$, *any multiple of $45\degree$ will be a multiple of $\dfrac{\pi}{4}$ too.* For example, $315\degree$ is $45\times7$, so its radian measure will be $\dfrac{\pi}{4}\times 7 = \dfrac{7\pi}{4}$.
