## Basic results
The derivative of anything with a $c$ at the start has a -ve sign in front, that's a way to remember the signs of these derivatives.

$sin\:x$ and $cos\:x$ has easy identities to remember. The rest can be a little trickier, so here are the derivations of these derivatives.

> [!NOTE] Use chain rule with trig differentiation
> Since trig functions may contain a function inside, we have to use chain rule there. For example, $cos(x^3)$ is differentiated as $-sin(x^{3})\times 3x^2$. Another example is:

In that case, $\dfrac{d}{dx}(sin\:\theta)=\dfrac{d}{d\theta}(sin\:\theta)\times\dfrac{d\theta}{dx}$. Sometimes, we may not have $\dfrac{d\theta}{dx}$, so we take the reciprocal of $\dfrac{dx}{d\theta}$ if we have that.

## Inverse trig derivatives

We'll go over the derivations for $sin,\: tan$ and $sec$, since the rest is the same but with a minus sign.
