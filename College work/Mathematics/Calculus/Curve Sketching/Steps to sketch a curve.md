The steps to be followed when sketching a curve are:
1. Finding the domain
2. Finding the x and y intercepts
3. Check if its increasing or decreasing
4. Find its curvature
5. Check the behavior at extreme points ($x\to \pm \infty$)
6. Check for asymptotes
7. Identify the extrema

*Note:* In case of rational functions, also check for symmetry.
