A limit is a way to *describe how a function behaves when the variable approaches a certain value.* The limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches some value of $a$ is the value that $f(x)$ gets closer to as $x$ gets closer to $a$. It is written like as $\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x)$, and read as "the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$.

Suppose we have the function $f(x)=x^2$. If you want to find its limit as $x$ approaches 2, you'll write $\lim\limits_{x\to 2}x^2$. **We know that as $x$ gets closer to 2, the value of $x^2$ gets closer to 4.** Therefore, we say $\lim\limits_{x\to 2}x^{2}=4$.
