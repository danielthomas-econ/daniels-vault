The `<a href>` tag is used to create links. `a` stands for 'anchor' while `href` is short for hypertext reference.

You can link a site within your project using `<a href = "path/filename.html> Click here </a>`. *The text in between `<a>` and `</a>` become the clickable link.* Example:
~~~html
<p> Visit <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> to get a better understanding on Obsidian</p>
~~~
This gives us a clickable link to YouTube so that we can learn more about Obsidian. In our webpage, it looks like this:
