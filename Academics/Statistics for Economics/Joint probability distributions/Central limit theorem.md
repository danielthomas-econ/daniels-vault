## Statement
Let $X_{1},X_{2},\dots X_{n}$ be a random sample from a distribution (any distribution) with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^{2}$. Then, *if $n$ is sufficiently large,* $\bar{X}$ has approximately a normal distribution with $\mu_{\bar{X}}=\mu$ and $\sigma^{2}_{\bar{X}}= \dfrac{\sigma^{2}}{n}$ and $T_{0}$ also has an approximately normal distribution with $\mu_{T_{0}}=n\mu$ and $\sigma^{2}_{T_{0}}=n\sigma^{2}$. *The larger the $n$*, *the better the approximation. $n>30$ is typically considered enough to apply CLT.*
