## Types of sampling
*1. Random sampling*
*2. Stratified sampling:* The population is divided into groups (strata), and random samples are taken from each strata to ensure different groups from the population are proportionately represented.
*3. Systematic sampling:* Picking every $n^{th}$ object in the population.
*4. Cluster sampling:* The population is divided into naturally occurring groups (clusters), and entire clusters are randomly selected.

The 4 types of sampling explained above are probability based sampling techniques. There is one more type of sampling called *convenience sampling.* This is when you pick the objects in the population based on your convenience. Just don't use this. Ever.

> [!warning] Self-selection bias
> This is when participants select themselves to be a part of the sample. **Only the people who relate to the topic will volunteer** to be a part of the sample, meaning we end up with skewed data.

## Types of studies
There are two types of studies: *Observational and Experimental.* Observational studies are your typical studies, where **we simply observe what happens without any intervention.** Example: We compare the marks of coaching and non-coaching in their 12th boards. 

The problem is that *this doesn't always capture the full picture.* We could obtain a result saying that coaching students score better. But what if this is because we typically see more studious students going for coaching, while the slackers don't. This doesn't prove that coaching is the reason that we see a mark increase.

To fix this, we use experimental studies. In this system, we **manipulate the independent variable to see its effect on the dependent variables.** This involves the creation of two groups: *treatment and control group.* 

Let's look at the same example as before but through the lens of an experimental study. We'll take a group of 11th graders with no coaching and divide them into two groups: one gets coaching (treatment) and one group continues without tuitions (control). By comparing the scores of treatment to control group, **we can truly tell if coaching is the real reason we see an increase in marks.** Since the groups are random, we no longer have the type of student as a possible factor for an increase in marks. *Thus, experimental studies help us control external factors and get more accurate results.*

> [!NOTE] Fun fact
> Economists got the idea of dividing the population into two groups from clinical trials, where one group is given the true medicine (treatment) and one is given a placebo (control). *These trials are called Randomized Control Trials (RCTs).*
