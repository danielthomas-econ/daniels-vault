An equation can be symmetric in 3 ways:
- About the $x$ axis/polar axis
- About the $y$ axis/$\theta=\frac{\pi}{4}$
- About the origin/pole

### Symmetric about the x axis (polar axis)
In the cartesian system, we **replace $y$ with $-y$**. If we get the same output, the equation is symmetric along the $x$ axis. For example, $y^2=x$ is symmetric because both $y$ and $-y$ end up the same when squared. Graphically, it looks like:

In the polar system, we replace $\theta$ with $-\theta$. In both systems, **we make the 2nd coordinate negative.** An example would be $r=\cos\theta$. We know that $\cos\theta=\cos-\theta$, so the $cos$ function satisfies this symmetry by definition.

### Symmetric about the y axis (theta = pi/4)
In the cartesian system, we replace $x$ with $-x$ and see if we get the same result. Eg: $x^2=y$.

In the polar system, **we replace $\theta$ with $\pi-\theta$**. This is because $\pi-\theta$ will always be a direct reflection of $\theta$ along the $y$ axis. We can see that *going $\pi$ degrees from the polar axis and then backwards $\theta$ degrees will take us the mirror image of $\theta$*.

### Symmetric about the origin (pole)
In the cartesian system, we **replace both coordinates with their negative values** and see if we still get the same values. 

In the polar system, we **either replace $r$ with $-r$ OR $\theta$ with $\theta+\pi$**. Only one of these giving the same value is sufficient to  prove that the equation is symmetric about the pole.

> [!Warning] The converse is not true
> While either replacing $r$ with $-r$ or $\theta$ with $\theta+\pi$ is enough to prove that it is symmetric about the pole, the converse is not true. This means that we cannot say that $r$ and $-r$ or $\theta$ and $\theta+\pi$ will give the same values if we know that an equation is symmetric about the pole.
