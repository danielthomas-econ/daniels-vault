## Common trig ratios
We know the basic trig ratios of $sin,\:cos$ and $tan$ in 10th grade, and memorized their ratios using SOHCAHTOA. There are three other ratios, which are $cosec,\:sec$ and $cot$.These are just 1 over $sin,\:cos$ and $tan$ respectively.

There are also some common values that are better to 
memorize, given in the table below. I memorized $sin$ values using *1, 1, root 3; 2, root 2, 2.* $cos$ is the same but numerators are switched. $tan$ keeps the same numerator as $sin$, but the denominators are the reverse order of the numerators.

However, there's a good chance that we'll face values of $\theta$ that don't fit with these specific values. To calculate the value of trig ratios for such values of $\theta$, we use a unit circle.

## Unit circle
We'll be using a unit circle, a **circle with a radius of 1** with its center at the origin of a $xy$ plane. The unit doesn't matter here since it cancels out anyways. Therefore, our unit circle looks like this:

Since every point on the circle is $1$ unit away, **the hypotenuse (radius) is always equal to 1.** This simplifies our calculation for $sin$ and $cos$, since we no longer have to divide by the hypotenuse. *Therefore, in a unit circle only, $sin\:\theta$ equals the opposite side and $cos\:\theta$ equals the adjacent side.* This helps us directly obtain the values of $sin\:\theta$ and $cos\:\theta$, **as they are the coordinates of the point on the circle.** $cos\:\theta$ becomes the $x$ coordinate, and $sin\:\theta$ becomes the $y$ coordinate.

### Obtaining sin and cos values
We need to remember three main values to easily get most values of sin and cos. These are:
- Large = $\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
- Medium = $\dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
- Small = $\dfrac{1}{2}$

Since the **value of $cos\:\theta$ is the length on the $x$ axis, the smallest length will be $cos\:\dfrac{\pi}{3}$, which is equal to our small value of $\dfrac{1}{2}$**. Similarly, the largest side for $cos$ will be $cos\:\dfrac{\pi}{6}$, which is equal to the large value of $\dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. *We can also apply this same logic for $sin$*, *but with vertical lines (since $sin$ is the y coordinate).* When we do that, we see $sin\:\dfrac{\pi}{6}$ to be the small value and $sin\:\dfrac{\pi}{3}$ to be the large value.

### Positive and negative values
Since $cos$ is the $x$ value and $sin$ is the $y$ value, *the value of our $sin$ and $cos$ depends on the quadrants.* 
- In the first quadrant, both values are positive.
- In the second quadrant, $cos$ is negative since $x$ is negative.
- In the third quadrant, both values are negative. **This means the value of $tan$ will be positive** ($tan=\dfrac{sin}{cos}$, signs cancel).
- In the fourth quadrant, $sin$ is negative.
