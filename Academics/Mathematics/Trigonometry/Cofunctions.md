Some functions are cofunctions of each other. We can find the cofunction pairs through the names of the functions.
- $sine,\:cosine$
- $tangent,\: cotangent$
- $secant,\: cosecant$

These functions are complementary, meaning that $sin\:\theta=cos(\dfrac{\pi}{2}-\theta)$ or $cos(90\degree-\theta)$. We can substitute $sin$ and $cos$ with any of the other cofunction pairs and get the same result.

Complementary functions also exist for $\dfrac{\pi}{2}/90+\theta$. However, we have to be careful here *since the sign changes for all cofunctions except $sin$*. This is because $sin$ is positive in the 2nd quadrant, which is where $\dfrac{\pi}{2}+\theta$ lies.

### Supplementary angle identities
Under these identities, *there is no change in function, only change in the sign of the functions.* All of them flip their sign due to the $(\pi-x)$. This is because $(\pi-x)$ lies in the second quadrant, where only $sin$ is positive. **Therefore, the identity for $sin$ does not change the sign at all.** 

On the other hand, $(\pi+x)$ is in the 3rd quadrant, where $tan$ is positive. This means that the sign is flipped for $sin$ and $cos$, but stays the same for $tan$.
