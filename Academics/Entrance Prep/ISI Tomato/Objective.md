Q1) If $\dfrac{{a+b}}{b+c}=\dfrac{{c+d}}{d+a}$, then: a) $a=c$, b) either $a=c$ or $a+b+c+d=0$, c) $a+b+c+d=0$, d) $a=c$ and $b=d$ $\text{(ISI Tomato objective Q15)}$

Ans) Start by subtracting $1$ on both sides. **This will help eliminate the b and d terms in the numerator and leaves everything in terms of a and c.** This leaves you with $\dfrac{{a-c}}{b+c}=\dfrac{{c-a}}{d+a}$
$\implies \dfrac{{a-c}}{{b+c}}=\dfrac{{-(a-c)}}{d+a}$
$\implies \dfrac{{a-c}}{{b+c}}+\dfrac{{a-c}}{d+a}=0$
$\implies {a-c}\left[ \dfrac{{d+a+b+c}}{(b+c)(d+a)} \right]=0$
$\implies (a-c)(d+a+b+c)=0$
Therefore, option b) is the right answer.

I should've seen that basically every option contains $a=c$ or $a+b+c+d=0$. So when I start to solve, I should've started in a way that will help me get to this. *When we have two similar looking rational functions like this, subtracting 1 can help bring out some kind of symmetry.* Here, subtracting 1 showed that the two numerators were negatives of each other. That helped in taking common out. I just tried cross multiplying and gave up when that didn't work out.

Q2) If $a,b,c,d$ satisfy the following equations, then $(a+d)(b+c)$ equals $a)\:16$, $b)\: -16$, $c)\:0$, $d)$ none
