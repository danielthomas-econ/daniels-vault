## What are linear functions
$y=ax+b$ is the typical way to represent linear functions. This shows us that $y$ changes at a constant rate $a$ as $x$ increases. $a$ is called the slope of the function, while $b$ is the $y$-intercept. To find the $x$-intercept (solution of the function), we use $-\dfrac{b}{a}$.

## Properties of linear functions
Every linear function must fulfill two properties:
- Additivity: $f(a+b)=f(a)+f(b)$
- Scalar multiplication: $f(\alpha x)=\alpha f(x)$

However, *not all straight lines fulfill these properties.* In fact, only functions defined by $y=ax$ fulfill these conditions. This means that **all linear functions pass through the origin.** Straight lines that don't pass through the origin are called affine functions.
