## Shifting graphs
### $y=f(x)\pm c$ (upward/downward shift)
Adding or subtracting $c$ to the function shifts it upwards or downwards (depending on the sign of $c$) by $c$ units.

### $y=f(x\pm c)$ (leftward/rightward shift)
Adding or subtracting $c$ directly to the argument $x$ shifts the function to the left or the right depending on the sign of $c$. **This one is a little confusing, but $+c$ goes leftward and $-c$ goes rightward.** The reason is that with the function $f(x+c)$, at $x=0$ we have $f(c)$. Therefore, to get $f(0)$, we need to take $x=-c$. This means that *wherever the function was previously at $f(0)$*, *it will now be at $f(-c)$*.

We can see that the vertex of the parabola, which is $f(0)$ of $x^{2}$, shifted to $-2$ for $(x+2)^{2}$, since the $f(0)$ equivalent will be $f(-c)$ now.

## Mirroring graphs
### $y=-f(x)$ (along the $x$ axis)
When we apply the negative side to the final value of the output, *its like we are getting $-y$ in effect.* Think about it as $-y=f(x)$. Therefore, all the $y$ coordinates have now been changed to its opposite sign. Since all the $y$ coordinates are changing, *its like the function was mirrored along the $x$ axis.*

### $y=f(-x)$ (along the $y$ axis)
In this case, the $y$ stays the same and the $x$ is now the negative value of what it once was. Therefore, **all values of $x$ switch sides, so the function is mirrored along the $y$ axis.**
