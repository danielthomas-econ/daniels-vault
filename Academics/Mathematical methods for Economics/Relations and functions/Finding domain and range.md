## Finding the domain
To find the domain, we need to find *all values of $x$ for which the function gives a meaningful output.* The part 'meaningful output' is very important here, especially in terms of economics. Suppose our cost function is $C(x)=10x+25$. We'd typically say the domain of $C(x)$ is $\mathbb{R}$. However, this is a cost function. **Therefore, negative values of $x$ don't make sense in this equation since we cannot produce negative output.** In this case, the domain would be $[0,\infty)$.

### Patterns to look out for
Always check for *fractions and square roots.* These two are the most commonly asked types of find the domain question. This is because they have certain restrictions: **a fraction's denominator can't be zero, and the value inside a square root can't be negative.** We need to adjust our domain to fit these restrictions. To do this, we must:
- Set the value inside the root to be $\ge 0$ and then solve the inequality for $x$
- For fractions, the domain will be all real numbers except the one which makes the denominator $0$. If $y=\dfrac{1}{x-3}$, the domain is $\mathbb{R}\setminus 3$.

Eg: Find the domain of $y=\sqrt{ 5-x }$.
We know that the value under the root must always be a non-negative value. Therefore, $5-x \ge 0$. This means that $5\ge x$. Since $x$ must be less than or equal to $5$, the domain will be $(-\infty,5]$.


## Finding the range
The range of a function is all possible outputs it can produce. In practice, the only real restriction here is that all squared or square rooted values must be greater than or equal to zero.
