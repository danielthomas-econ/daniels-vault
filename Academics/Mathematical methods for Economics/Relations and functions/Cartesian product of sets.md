The cartesian product of two sets is the *set of ordered pairs* where the first element of each pair comes from the first set, and the second element of each pair comes from the second set.

Given sets $A$ and $B$, you can define the cartesian product as $A \times B$, where $A \times B = {(a,b) | a\in A\: and\: b\in B}$.

> [!warning] Cartesian product is NOT commutative
> The cartesian products $A\times B$ and $B\times A$ are not the same. This is because the ordered pairs in $A\times B$ have first element from set $A$, while the pairs in $B\times A$ are from set $B$. Therefore, **they do not have equal ordered pairs.**


## Number of elements
To find the number of elements in a cartesian product, i.e. $n(A\times B)$, we use $n(A) \times n(B)$.Therefore, if we have set $A$ with 3 elements and set $B$ with 2 elements, $n(A\times B) = 6$.
