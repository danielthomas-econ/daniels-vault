## Basic inequalities
Q) Find all the values of $x$ for which the inequality $(x-1)(3-x)>0$ is satisfied.
?
Ans)![[Pasted image 20240930174106.png]]
We can see that the *critical values* of $x$ are $1$ and $3$. We split the number line accordingly and check the sign in each section of the line. Doing this, we see that the expression only holds true for $x\in (1,3)$.

Q) Find the solution set of $\dfrac{2p-3}{p-1}>3-p$.
?

**Mistake made:** I cross multiplied $p-1$ and completely forgot about it. When solving inequalities for rational functions, *we have to consider the denominator too for finding critical points.* This means we take $p-1=0$ as a factor. Ultimately, this gives us $0,1,2$ as critical points of the function.

## Double inequalities
This tells us that if $a<z$ and $z<b$, then $a<z<b$. This is most useful when we need to *solve inequalities involving absolute values.* 

If we are given that $|x|<a$, then we can say that $-a<x<a$. If $|x|>0$, then $x>a$ or $x<-a\implies x\in(-\infty,a)\cup(a,\infty)$. 



## Flashcards
Q1) $\dfrac{{x^{2}-9}}{x^{2}-1}<0$. Find the solution set of $x$.
?
Ans) Factorizing the LHS, we get $\dfrac{{(x+3)(x-3)}}{(x+1)(x-1)}<0$. *We know the LHS will be negative if the numerator and denominator have opposite signs.* Make a number line to check for the signs of the numerator and denominator. The area where they have opposite signs will be our solution. The final answer should be $x\in (-3,-1)\cup(1,3)$.
