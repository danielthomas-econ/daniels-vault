The idea of negation in logic is closely related to the set complement in [[Set theory and logical operators|set theory]]. We use the symbol $\sim$ to denote negation.

The main idea in negation is to **switch and/or with each other.** This is usually enough to negate an idea. We can do this by:
- $not\:(P\:or\:Q)=(not\:P)\:and\:(not\:Q)$
- $not(P\:and\:Q)=(not\:P)\:or\:(not\:Q)$

This method of negation works for implications with [[Quantifiers|quantifiers]] too. We simply **switch the quantifiers and add not** to negate the implication. This is done by:
- $\exists\:x\in A,\:s.t.\:P(x)$ is true
- Negation: $\forall\:x\in A,\:P(x)$ is not true 

- $\forall\:x\in A,\: Q(x)$ is true
- Negation: $\exists\:x\in A,\:s.t.\:Q(x)$ is not true.
