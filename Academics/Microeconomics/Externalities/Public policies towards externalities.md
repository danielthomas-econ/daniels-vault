## Command and control
### Regulation
The government can remedy an externality by either requiring or banning certain actions. Eg: Considering pollution is a negative externality, the government could ban any activity that creates pollution. However, this comes with an obvious flaw: It is nearly impossible to carry out such a task. Society must weigh the benefits and costs of pollution and decide what level of pollution they find acceptable.

## Market based policies
### Pigovian taxes/subsidies
As discussed previously, a commodity with a negative externality will have a [[Impact of externalities on markets#^85cbc9|leftward shifted demand curve]] wrt private demand. *One way to internalize the externality would be to tax the consumers, so that the private demand curve shifts leftward.* If the value of the tax/unit is the same as the externality imposed per unit, the private demand curve becomes equivalent to the social demand curve. Therefore, the market itself will produce the socially optimal level of output. **This is called a corrective tax, or a Pigovian tax.**

Most economists prefer corrective taxes over regulation as they reduce pollution with a lower cost to society. Let's go through a case study, comparing a paper mill and a steel factory, and see whether taxes are actually better than regulation policies.

### Case study: Pigovian taxes vs regulation

> [!tip] Abatement costs
> *The cost tolerated to reduce pollution is called abatement cost.* It starts out low, as we don't need to spend much to reduce the first few units of pollution. However, once we have reduced a lot of pollution, the cost incurred to reduce more pollution increases. Therefore, marginal abatement costs keep rising.

Plotting the points, we get the following diagram.
![[UntitledglopefoEFIOJCOSTTX.jpg|center|550]]
Since we have glop on the x axis and MAC (marginal abatement costs) measure reduction in glop (pollution), *we plot the points from right to left, the direction of decreasing glop.* We can see that the MAC curve closely resembles the demand curve for glop.

In the diagram, we have also imposed a tax/unit of $t$ per unit. In a way, abatement costs = marginal costs while the tax/unit = marginal benefit. **The tax becomes our marginal benefit because if we reduce glop, we gain t dollars as we no longer have to spend t dollars paying the tax.** Therefore, a producer will continue abating as long as $MC<MB$. This raises the $MC$ and will continue until $MC=MB$.

Lets use an example. Suppose the tax is $\$1000$ per unit of glop. The firm will continue abating as long as their $MAC$ is less than $\$1000$, as this means they spend only their abatement costs and not $\$1000$. When $MAC=1000$, they will be indifferent, but **they will not abate if their marginal cost exceeds $\$1000$**. This is because they'd prefer to simply pay the tax than spend more on reducing their own pollution. Therefore, in the above diagram, $\triangle QEX$ shows us the total glop reduced.

Going back to the paper mill and steel factory example,
