## Externalities
An externality is when a person engages in an action that impacts the wellbeing of a bystander but *neither pays nor receives compensation for that effect.*

The problem here is that **buyers and sellers neglect external effects of their actions** when they choose what quantity to demand and supply. This means that while markets typically maximize private benefit, they fail to maximize the benefit to society as a whole. Therefore, **the market equilibrium is not efficient when there are externalities.**

## Property rights
A world without property rights would be chaotic as no property rights means *everybody owns everything.* This means that if you consume a good, you are imposing an externality on everybody else (since technically everybody owns that good you just consumed).

Market interactions rely on property rights being defined. **Externalities can only occur when property rights are ill defined.** This means that the property rights favor one party, so that party can impose an externality on the other.
