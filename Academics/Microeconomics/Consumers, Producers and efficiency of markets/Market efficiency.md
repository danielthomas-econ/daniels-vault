Studying market efficiency is aimed at examining whether the market's allocation of resources is desirable or not. To do this, *we'll consider total surplus as our metric of welfare.* Therefore, in this system, an efficient allocation is one that maximizes total surplus.

## Market outcomes
If you look at a diagram of market equilibrium, you'll notice that both the demand and supply curves are effectively cut into two parts by the point of equilibrium. 

The part above equilibrium represents the buyers who are willing to pay more than the equilibrium price. The part below represents sellers willing to less at less than the equilibrium price. **It is these buyers and sellers that have resources allocated to them in a market economy.** Therefore, two market outcomes are:
1) Free markets *allocate supply of goods to buyers who value them the most,* measured by their willingness to pay.
2) Free markets allocate the demand of goods to *sellers who can produce them at the lowest cost.*

We can also say that the point of equilibrium divides the graph into the left and right halves. In the left half (any quantity less than equilibrium quantity), **the value to the marginal buyer exceeds the cost for the marginal seller.** Therefore, it makes sense to increase the quantity sold. If the quantity sold is more than equilibrium (right side), the value to the marginal buyer is less than the cost of the marginal seller. *Therefore, no rational consumer would purchase the commodity at this point, meaning there is no incentive to continue selling this quantity.* Therefore, the quantity sold will decrease till it reaches the equilibrium quantity. This tells us the third market outcome:
3) Free markets produce the quantity of goods that *maximizes the sum of consumer and producer surplus.*
