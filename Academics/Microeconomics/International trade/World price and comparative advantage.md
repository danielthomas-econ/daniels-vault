## World price
In our analysis, we look at two distinct entities: the domestic economy and the rest of the world. When there is no trade, the domestic price is at equilibrium. *The price prevailing in the international markets is called world price.* A small country has to take the world price as a given. This is because they cannot buy/sell enough to make a dent in the world market. **A large country like China on the other hand can impact the world price.** They are large enough that they can buy/sell enough of a commodity that the rest of the world shifts according to how much this country buys or sells.

However, we will stick to the **small economy assumption,** which states that our country is too small the impact the world price, and must take it as a given. Therefore, *the domestic economy is a price taker.* In a way, the small economy assumption tries to mirror perfect competition at the world level.

When this economy opens up, either $P_{w}>P_{d}$ or $P_{w}<P_{d}$. Based on which case we face, the consumers and producers in the domestic market will react differently.

## Comparative advantage
Whether we face $P_{w}>P_{d}$ or $P_{w}<P_{d}$ depends on if the domestic country has a [[Comparative and absolute advantage|comparative advantage]] wrt the rest of the world.

We know that the *domestic price tells us the opportunity cost of producing a commodity.* If the domestic price is low, **that tells us the domestic economy has a comparative advantage wrt the rest of the world.** This means they will *specialize in the area of their advantage and export* whatever excess quantity they have. Another way to look at it is if $P_{w}>P_{d}$, then domestic sellers know that they can receive $P_{w}$ in the international market, so they will only sell at $P_{w}$ and at nothing less. Therefore, they end up exporting the commodity due to lack of domestic demand at $P_{w}$.
