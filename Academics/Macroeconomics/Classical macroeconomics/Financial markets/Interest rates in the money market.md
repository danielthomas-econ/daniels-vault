## Assumptions
Note that there are **two types of money:** checkable deposits  and currency. *We'll start by assuming checkable deposits don't exist.*

## Equilibrium conditions

### Without checkable deposits
Suppose the central bank supplies an amount of money equal to $M$. Then the money supply $M^{s}=M$. Since we need $\text{Money Supply = Money demand}$, we get $$\begin{align}
M=\$YL(&i) \\
\end{align}$$This tells us that the equilibrium interest rate is such that *given their income $Y$*, *people are willing to hold an amount of money equal to the money supply.* This is called the LM (liquidity-money) relation.

The money demand curve is downward sloping as $M^d$ and $i$ have a negative relationship, while the money supply curve is perfectly inelastic as *$M^s$ is independent of $i$*.

### With checkable deposits
It is basically the same as above, but we replace money demand with demand for central bank money.

Demand for central bank money has a negative relation with interest rate since increasing interest rate reduces demand for currency and checkable deposits (money), which reduces demand for reserves as well. Also, central bank sets the money supply at $H$, and it is not impacted by the rate of interest. $H$ can be changed through open market operations however.
