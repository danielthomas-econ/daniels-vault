## The production function
The production function is a **relationship between the level of output and the level of factor inputs.** For each level of inputs, the production function shows the resulting level of output and is written as:
$$Y=F(\bar{K}, N)$$
where:
$Y$ - Level of output
$\bar{K}$ - Stock of capital (fixed in the short run, denoted by the bar)
$N$ - Quantity of homogenous labor input

Classical economists considered the level of technology and population to be fixed in the short run. **Therefore, output varies solely with increase in labor input $N$**.

### Marginal product of labor (MPN)
The table below shows us the relation between output and labor. It also gives us the marginal product of labor (MPN), which is the additional output produced by one additional unit of labor, or $\dfrac{\Delta Y}{\Delta N}$ mathematically. *Therefore, MPN is the slope of the production curve.* As you can see, **MPN starts out constant, but then each additional unit of labor gives us a smaller increase in output. Therefore, although output increases, MPN starts to diminish.** Eventually, using one additional unit of labor will actually decrease output. This happens when too many people are employed for a certain task. Since output falls, MPN is negative. **No firm would hire an extra unit of labor that reduces their total output.**

The production function is a *straight line at low levels of output, due to the constant slope.* Therefore, in the area of constant returns to scale, the production function is a straight line. The next region is **diminishing returns,** where output increases but MPN falls. Since the MPN, the slope of the production function, falls but is still positive, **the production function increases at a decreasing rate.** In the last region of negative returns, MPN becomes negative, so the production function falls.
