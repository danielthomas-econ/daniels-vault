## Labor demand
In the classical model, firms and individual workers optimize and wages adjust instantly, so the market must clear. Firms are perfect competitors that choose their output to maximize profits. **A perfectly competitive firm will increase output until the marginal cost of a unit is equal to its marginal revenue.** In perfect competition, marginal revenue is equal to price. *Since output is solely determined by labor, the marginal cost is equal to marginal cost of labor.* The marginal cost of labor is the money wage divided by the output produced by this additional unit of labor (wage per unit of output). Recall that the units of output produced by one additional unit of labor is [[Production#Marginal product of labor (MPN)|the MPN]] of that unit of labor. Therefore, we can say
$$MC = \dfrac{W}{MPN}$$

We know that the profit maximizing condition in perfectly competitive markets is $P=MC$. Therefore, at the profit maximizing position for firms, we can say that:
$$MPN = \dfrac{W}{P}$$

Interpreting this, we can say **that firms will hire up to the point where additional output obtained by hiring one more worker is equal to the real wage paid to hire the worker.**

The labor curve slopes downward due to the law of diminishing returns. At a quantity of labor below 3, say 2, the *MPN (10) is greater than the real wage (8). Therefore, profits will be increased by hiring an additional unit* since the value of output produced (MPN) is greater than the cost of hiring this unit of labor (real wage). This will continue until MPN equals the real wage, which will be the equilibrium level of labor demand. **It is important to note that the labor demand curve is simply the MPN curve.**

An important implication of the MPN curve being the demand for labor curve is that *labor demand has an inverse relation to real wages.* As seen above, the higher the real wage, the lower the level of employment that would equate real wage to MPN. Therefore, the aggregate demand for labor in the economy is given by the formula:
$$\begin{align}
N^{d}= &f\left( \dfrac{W}{P} \right) \\
&\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }(-)
\end{align}$$

## Labor supply
We know that individuals aim to maximize their utility. A worker gets positive utility from two things: real income and leisure. *However, these two are incompatible with each other, so there must be a tradeoff.* The individual must allocate parts of the 24 hour day to work and leisure, as he cannot do both simultaneously. 

On the horizontal axis, we have hours of leisure per day, with the maximum being 24 hours. The hours worked is given by 24 minus leisure hours consumed. The slope gives us the real wage times the hours worked by the individual, with the intercept being real wage times 24 (zero hours of leisure consumed).

The **slope of the indifference curves $U_{1},U_{2},U_{3}$ is MRS between leisure and income.** The straight lines originating at 24 hours of leisure is the budget line, **with the slope of the budget line being the real wage since each extra hour of leisure forgoes an hour that could be used to earn a wage.** Therefore, a budget line corresponding to a higher real wage will be steeper. At the point where IC is tangent to the budget line, MRS = real wage.

The leisure consumed by the individual is decided by where the IC curve is tangential to the budget line for a given real wage. Using this, we can derive the hours of labor supplied at a given real wage rate. **By plotting this, we get an upward sloping labor supply curve.**

Since there is a positive relationship between labor supply and real wages, we can say that:
$$\begin{align}
N^{s}= &\:g\left( \dfrac{W}{P} \right) \\
&\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }\text{ }(+)
\end{align}$$
**It is important to note that labor supply is determined by REAL wages, not money wages.** This is because the individual's labor supply decision is based on how many goods and services he can consume for each hour of labor supplied. If the money wage goes up, but so does the price, then his consumption will not increase. However, an increase in real wage always increases his consumption potential. Therefore, real wages, not money wages, determine level of labor supply.

### Income and substitution effect
We have seen that the labor supply curve is upward sloping. However, this relies on a fundamental assumption. The upward sloping curve means *more labor is supplied at higher wage rates.* This is because as the real wage rate increases, the cost of leisure increases. Therefore, the individual will reduce his consumption of leisure and increase hours worked. **Substituting hours of leisure with increased hours of work due to the higher cost of leisure is the substitution effect.** Our upward sloping curve assumes the substitution effect holds for the individual.

However, we know that the **income effect** also exists. This tells us that as the real wage increases, the workers have a higher real income. *At high levels of real income, an increase in wage becomes less attractive, and at a high enough level of real income, they would prefer consuming leisure even with an increase in real wage.* At this point, the income effect outweighs the substitution effect and we get a downward sloping demand curve. For the purposes of classical economics, **we assume the substitution effect is stronger, and hence we have an upward sloping labor supply curve.**

## Determinants of output and employment
It is VERY important to note that **in the classical model, the level of output and employment are determined solely by SUPPLY side factors.** The level of output and employment are determined by the position of the labor demand/supply curves and the aggregate production function.

If there is an increase in technological advancement or stock of capital, the production function rotates upward. *This is because increase in those two factors increases MPN, so the slope of the production function becomes steeper.* Consequently, these changes mean the labor demand curve $N^{d}$ shifts rightward as $N^{d}= MPN$.

We have to draw the two graphs above each other. The equilibrium level of employment in the labor market will be substituted in the aggregate production function to find $Y$ for equilibrium level of $N$.

As previously discussed, money wages don't determine anything, it is real wages that do. We will illustrate this in more detail now. To do this, we'll draw $N^d$ and $N^s$ graphs with $N$ on the x axis and $W$ (not $\dfrac{W}{P}$) on the y axis.

For labor supply, we can draw a positively sloped curve $N^{s}(P_{1})$ which gives the labor supplied for each money wage *given that we are at $P_{1}$ price level.* This means we get different curves for different price levels. Let's say that for $N^{s}(P_{1})$, we have $N_{1}$ level of employment at $W_{1}$ level of money wage.

At a price level $2P_{1}$, we get $N^s(2P_{1})$. Less labor is supplied at every money wage because due to the doubling in price, real wages halve, so labor supply falls to $N'_{2}<N_{1}$. **However, if $W$ rises to $W_{2}$ s.t. $\dfrac{W_{2}}{2P_{1}}=\dfrac{W_{1}}{P_{1}}$ (real wage is same), then the level of employment for $N^{s}(2P_{1})$ at $W_{2}$ is $N_{1}$**. This tells us an individual worker is interested only in real wage, and that *equiproportional increases/decreases in money wages and price levels leave real wages, and hence quantity of labor, unchanged.*

### Increase in labor force
In the exam, **draw labor market equilibrium graph first then the production function.** An increase in labor force means $N$ increases from $N_{1}$ to $N_{2}$. Since this is just a movement along the x axis, *there is no shift in the production function, only a movement along it.*

### Increase in capital
Once again, draw labor market equilibrium first. Here, *output increases due to an increase in capital, which is not on the x axis.* Therefore, there will be a shift in the production function.

## Aggregate supply function
The aggregate supply function plots price on the x axis and output on the y axis. To plot this, we need to know *how will output vary with an increase in price?*

Consider the graph in the previous section. If we move to price level $2P_{1}$ while keeping money wage at $W_{1}$, real wages fall so firms try to expand employment and output. **The money wage will not stay at $W_{1}$ however.** We can see that keeping the money wage at $W_{1}$ leads to excess demand for labor, which increases money wages. The process of rising money wages only stops at money wage $2W_{1}$, which is the new equilibrium for the $N^s(2P_{1})$ curve. **This means the output supplied at $2P_{1}$ is $Y_{1}$**, **the same as the output supplied at $P_{1}$**. This tells us that in the classical model, *prices have no impact on output.* We get a straight vertical line as our aggregate supply curve.
