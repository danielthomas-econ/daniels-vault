## Key concept
The main idea behind classical economics is that *the equilibrium level of output at any time was a point of full employment.* This means the actual output is equal to the potential output. This was such an important tenet of classical economics that *they believed only full employment points of output could be positions of even short run equilibrium.* Absent full employment, classical economists assumed that the forces not in balance were acting to bring output to the full employment level.

## The classical revolution
Classical economics was **developed to counter mercantilism,** the prevailing economic thought of the 16th and 17th centuries. The main ideas of mercantilism were:
i) *Bullionism* - The belief that wealth of a nation was determined by its stock of precious metals.
ii) *Need for state action* - They believed the state must intervene to direct the development of capitalism.
iii) *Export focused protectionism* - Due to their belief in bullionism, they tried to maximize their exports and minimize imports to increase their stock of precious metals.

In contrast to mercantilism, classical economists stressed the idea of **real factors determine the wealth of nations, not stock of precious metals.** This meant the growth of an economy depended on an increase in stock of factors of production or advancements in techniques of production. *They believed money had no intrinsic value and only served as a medium of exchange.* 

Classical economists also **opposed government intervention** and believed in the self-adjusting tendencies of the free market. Under mercantilism, the government ensured that there was a market for all goods produced. However, *classical economists believed that consumption never needs encouragement* and opposed the idea of the state creating a market for goods.
