## The equation of exchange
It is an identity that relates the *volume of transactions at current prices $(P_{T}T)$ to supply of money times turnover rate of each dollar $(MV_{T})$*. The turnover rate is also called velocity of money, which is the average number of times a dollar is used in transactions. We use an equal to sign with three lines ($\equiv$) to denote identities. The equation of exchange identity is:
$$MV_{T}\equiv P_{T}T$$
where,
$M=\text{quantity of money}$
$V_{T}=\text{transaction velocity of money}$
$P_{T}= \text{price index of items traded}$
$T=\text{volume of transactions}$

This relationship holds due to the **ex post definition of velocity.** In other words, we define transaction velocity to make this identity hold. Therefore,
$$V_{T} \equiv \dfrac{P_{T}T}{M}$$

If we want to look at just income transactions, our formula is modified to:
$$MV \equiv PY$$
where,
$M= \text{quantity of money}$
$V=\text{income velocity of money}$
$P=\text{price index on current output}$
$Y=\text{level of current output}$

Once again, since this identity relies on $V$ being defined ex post, we can say $V=\dfrac{PY}{M}$.

Fisher, the economist who came up with this, believed that **velocity depended on institutional factors** like payment habits and payment technology. He also believed that since this was unlikely to change in the short run, $V$ **could be regarded as fixed in the short run, and so could $Y$**.

Keeping these two fixed gives us the equation:
$$\begin{align}
M\bar{V}\equiv&\:P\bar{Y} \\
\text{or} \\
P\equiv &\dfrac{\bar{V}}{\bar{Y}}M
\end{align}$$

### Interpretation
This equation gives us the basic result of the quantity theory of money: *The price level in the economy is directly proportional to the money supply.*

We can also say that the price level is directly proportional to velocity of money and inversely proportional to output, but these results aren't as significant as the first one.

## The Cambridge approach
The Cambridge approach **gets the same result as the Fisherian approach but in a different way.** This approach was created by Alfred Marshall and AC Pigou, economists at Cambridge.

They started by considering an individual's decision to hold money. Currency is only held for transaction purposes and has no return. *Therefore, we only hold money to the extent that its convenience outweighs the return we'd get from investing it.* Cambridge economists considered money demand to be a proportion of nominal income.
$$M^{d}= kPY$$

We can rewrite this as 
$$M \dfrac{1}{k}=P\bar{Y}$$
If we compare this to Fischer's equation, we see that $k=\dfrac{1}{V}$. Therefore, both $k$ and $Y$ are fixed in the short run. *Once again, we see a direct relation between price level and quantity of money in the economy.* Classical economists believed this was the result of too much money chasing too few goods. Since output remained constant but money supply increases, there's more money chasing the same quantity of goods, putting an upward pressure on the price level.

## Classical aggregate demand curve
The quantity theory of money is the *implicit theory* of the aggregate demand for output in the classical model. Therefore, we can use this equation to derive the classical aggregate demand curve. We consider a certain value of $k$ and $M$, and we plot the graph of $P$ and $Y$, which have an inverse relationship.

If $M=300, k=\dfrac{1}{4}$, then $M \dfrac{1}{k}=1200$. Therefore, the graph must show all points for which $PY=1200$, making it a **rectangular hyperbola.** If we increase $M$ to $400$, then our graph becomes all points for which $PY=1600$. *Therefore, an increase in money supply leads to a rightward shift in the graph.*

Adding the aggregate supply curve gives a clear depiction of the quantity theory of money in action. We can see that since the AS curve is a vertical straight line, **a rise in money supply increases AD, which has no impact on output and simply leads to an equivalent increase in prices.**
