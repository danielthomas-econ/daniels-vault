## Aggregate demand
It is the *total amount of goods demanded in the economy.* It is given by the formula $AD = C + I + G + NX$. At equilibrium level, the quantity of output is equal to the quantity demanded. Therefore, $Y(\text{output}) = AD$. If the economy is not in equilibrium, then we have *unplanned inventory investment/disinvestment.* This is given by the formula $IU = Y-AD$, where $IU$ is the unplanned additions to inventory. Since it is unplanned $additions$ to inventory, it is positive when supply exceeds demand, or $Y>AD$.

## Consumption function
The relation between consumption and income is described by the consumption function. To find this relation, we'll keep $G$ and $NX$ at zero for simplicity. **We know consumption increases with the level of income.** However, a $\$100$ increase in income will probably result in an increase of consumption less than $\$100$. In other words, *increase in consumption is a fraction of increase in income.* This is called the **marginal propensity to consume (MPC),** denoted by $c$. We also assume there is some level of consumption necessary to survive even at no income, which is called autonomous consumption.

Putting all this information together, we get our consumption function as $C=\bar{C}+cY$, where $\bar{C}$ is autonomous consumption. From this equation, we can see that *the slope of the consumption function is the MPC.* The value of $\bar{C}$ must be greater than zero and $c \in(0,1)$.

## Savings function
For every dollar we earn, we spend $c$ dollars on consumption. But what happens to the remaining $1-c$ dollars? **The income not spent on consumption is called savings.** Therefore, $S=Y-C$. We can substitute $C$ as the consumption function. Solving, we get $S=-\bar{C} + (1-c)Y$. We can see that savings is also an increasing function of income as **the slope, the marginal propensity to save (MPS), is positive.**

## Equilibrium condition
We know our economy is in equilibrium when $AD=Y$. We'll start drawing our graph with a 45 degree line, denoting all the points where $AD=Y$. We know $AD=C+\bar{I}$, which can be further expanded into $AD=\bar{C}+cY+\bar{I}=\bar{A} +cY$, where $\bar{A}=\bar{C}+\bar{I}$, which is called autonomous spending.

Therefore, at equilibrium, we have $Y=\bar{A}+cY$. Solving this, we get the equilibrium level of output as $$Y_{0}=\left[ \dfrac{1}{1-c} \right]\bar{A}$$
Graphically, it looks like:
